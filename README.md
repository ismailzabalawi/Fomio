# Fomio

Fomio is a mobile-first social platform built with Expo and React Native. It reimagines traditional forums with an emphasis on community empowerment, privacy, and simplicity. Inspired by the clarity of modern messaging apps, Fomio aims to give every community a vibrant space where discussions thrive without heavy algorithmic interference.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   This launches the Expo CLI so you can run the app on an emulator, a physical device, or the web.

Fomio is still evolving. By running the project locally, you can explore the current prototype and contribute to shaping the future of community interaction.
