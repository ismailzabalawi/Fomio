## 📊 **Current Test Status**

### ✅ **Passing Tests**: 18/35 (51%)
- **StyledText Component**: ✅ All tests passing
- **Button Component**: ✅ 7/12 tests passing
- **Logger Utility**: ✅ 2/11 tests passing

### ⚠️ **Remaining Test Issues**: 17/35 (49%)

#### **1. Logger Tests** (9 failing)
- **Issue**: Logger output format doesn't match test expectations
- **Status**: Tests expect `[INFO]` format, but logger outputs timestamp format
- **Impact**: Low - Logger functionality works, just test expectations need updating

#### **2. Auth Integration Tests** (5 failing)
- **Issue**: Mock setup needs refinement for async operations
- **Status**: Tests expect state changes that don't happen in mocked environment
- **Impact**: Medium - Need to improve mock implementations

#### **3. Form Validation Tests** (1 failing)
- **Issue**: Dimensions mock not working properly
- **Status**: `Dimensions.get('window')` returns undefined
- **Impact**: Low - Easy fix with better mock

#### **4. Button Tests** (2 failing)
- **Issue**: Missing accessibility props in component
- **Status**: Tests expect `accessibilityLabel` and `accessibilityHint` props
- **Impact**: Low - Need to add accessibility props to Button component
