Introduction

This document establishes the fundamental rules and guiding principles for the Fomio project. It is designed to ensure that every team member—across all personas—aligns with our vision of creating a community-first, privacy-respecting, and user-empowering platform. These rules are the cornerstone of our development process and decision-making.

Core Principles
	•	User Empowerment & Freedom
Every feature and decision prioritizes the user’s ability to control their experience. We commit to minimal censorship, transparent moderation, and providing tools that empower community self-governance.
	•	Transparency & Open Communication
All major decisions, updates, and changes must be clearly documented and shared. Regular cross-team communication is essential for maintaining alignment with the project’s vision.
	•	Privacy-First Approach
Safeguarding user data and privacy is non-negotiable. Our design and development processes ensure that user information is handled with the highest standards of confidentiality and security.
	•	Simplicity & Elegance
We strive for a clean, intuitive, and fast user experience. Our design should feel modern and effortless, similar to the clarity and speed found in apps like Telegram.
	•	Modular & Scalable Architecture
The project is built with flexibility in mind. Our structure—organized as Hubs → Terets → Bytes—ensures that the platform can grow and evolve seamlessly over time.
	•	Community-Driven Development
Early adopters and community feedback shape our evolution. Every update should consider the real needs and challenges of our user base.
	•	Innovation & Agility
We encourage creative solutions and remain agile in our approach, continuously adapting to new ideas and emerging trends.

Roles & Responsibilities
	•	Visionary:
Sets the overall philosophy and long-term direction. Responsible for defining the Manifesto, AppStructure, and other guiding documents.
	•	UI/UX Persona:
Translates our vision into intuitive, user-friendly designs that embody the project’s principles.
	•	Frontend Persona:
Constructs the mobile app’s shell and flow, ensuring a seamless and engaging interface.
	•	API Engineer Persona:
Bridges the frontend with the backend by efficiently mapping and integrating data via REST and GraphQL interfaces.
	•	Product Engineer Persona:
Focuses on enhancing performance, caching, and overall user experience to ensure that the app remains responsive and reliable.
	•	Community Architect:
Designs the scalable community logic, including moderation, role management, and feedback systems that foster a healthy online environment.

Documentation & Communication
	•	Centralized Documentation:
All guiding documents, updates, and decisions should be stored in a well-organized structure (e.g., /Documentation/Vision/).
	•	Regular Updates:
Cross-team communication is critical. Regular status updates and feedback loops are required to ensure everyone is aligned with the project’s vision.
	•	Consistent Documentation Standards:
Use clear, concise, and accessible language in all documents. Every change should be accompanied by appropriate documentation.

Quality & Testing
	•	High Standards:
Maintain a commitment to high-quality, well-documented code and design. Regular reviews and testing cycles are mandatory.
	•	User-Centric Testing:
Validate every feature through user testing to ensure it meets the community’s needs and maintains the platform’s core values.
