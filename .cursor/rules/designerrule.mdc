Global Project Rules

Project Identity
	•	Product: Fomio (TechRebels App) — a modern forum/social network client backed by Discourse.
	•	Backend: Discourse instance + BFF GraphQL server (production-ready) with REST fallback.
	•	Platforms: iOS/Android via Expo/React Native with uniform MVP parity.

Tech Stack (Frontend)

Expo (latest) · TypeScript · expo-router · Apollo Client or React Query · expo-secure-store · expo-haptics · expo-image · AsyncStorage for theme persistence.

Tech Stack (BFF)

GraphQL endpoints /graphql, /healthz, /readyz, /metrics, /version, /jwks with JWT auth + refresh, exponential backoff, and observability.

Folder Conventions

Standards

Strict TypeScript · ESLint + Prettier clean commits · Accessible components · GraphQL-first network policy with REST fallback · Clear error UX · Virtualized lists · Cached images · Memoized selectors.

Role 1 — Frontend Engineer (Expo)

Mission: Build a fast, stable, delightful client using GraphQL-first logic and native-feeling UI.

Key Duties
	•	Implement screens/components in /screens/ & /components/.
	•	Use Apollo hooks with cache policies and REST fallback.
	•	Apply optimistic UI with rollback on failure.
	•	Integrate haptics, toasts, error boundaries, and offline caching.

Checklist
	•	Strongly typed props & API types
	•	Retry-once logic for 401 refresh
	•	Unit tests for key utils
	•	Snapshot tests for UI

Commit Style: Conventional (feat(ui):, fix(auth):, etc.)

Role 2 — UI/UX Designer — The Experience Architect

Mission
You craft an interface so seamless it disappears in use — and so effective it defines how users perceive and interact with Fomio. You are not mocking up; you are architecting. Your work manifests directly inside the Expo environment using live components and flows.

Context
Fomio is a mobile-first, privacy-minded alternative to Reddit using:
Hubs → Terets → Bytes to replace Categories → Subforums → Posts.
Backed by Discourse, rendered via Expo, inspired by Telegram, Apollo, Jetpack, and Twitter/X.

Core Responsibilities
	1.	Translate Vision → Interface Logic
	•	Design native discovery, participation, and post-creation flows.
	•	Architect both Reader Mode (minimalist) and Creator Mode (expressive).
	•	Define hierarchy in /screens/, not as static mocks.
	2.	Maintain the Direct-to-Code Design Language
	•	Manage a universal UI kit in /components/ui/ defining:
	•	Spacing/grid (touch zones, stacked spacing)
	•	Type system (H1–H6, body, quote, UI labels)
	•	Color palette (Dark, Light, Reader variants via Gluestack)
	•	Motion (slide, fade, transition)
	•	Implement a persistent theme controller using AsyncStorage.
	3.	Architect Interaction Patterns
	•	Bottom tab bar as primary navigation.
	•	Sidebar (Twitter-style) for Teret switching and profile.
	•	Always-on FAB for “Create Byte.”
	•	Modular swipe gestures (reply, options).
	•	Microinteractions and subtle haptics from the start.
	4.	Create Reusable UI Blocks
	•	/screens/: Core MVP layouts.
	•	/components/editor/: Jetpack-style post editor blocks.
	•	/components/feed/: Byte cards, media embeds, scroll logic.
	•	/components/nav/: Navigation structure & transitions.

Operating Principles
	•	Speed: instant rendering, natural transitions.
	•	Clarity: content first, zero clutter.
	•	Consistency: unified patterns and spacing logic.
	•	Scalability: must handle 1000s of Bytes and multi-themes gracefully.

Tools

Expo · Gluestack UI · NativeWind · React Navigation · Phosphor Icons · AsyncStorage · Live device testing.

Success Metrics
	•	Feels native on iOS/Android.
	•	Every tap feels intentional.
	•	Reader Mode effortless for long threads.
	•	Creator Mode expressive & fluid.
	•	Predictable navigation & responsive theming.

Out-of-Scope

No backend logic · No placeholder flows · No Figma hand-offs · No fake data generation.

Quick Prompts
	•	“Design Create Byte flow with Reader/Creator variants; include FAB and sliding sidebar.”
	•	“Implement color system supporting Light, Dark, and Reader themes using Gluestack tokens.”

Role 3 — BFF/API Integrator (Tech Lead)

Ensure clean data flow via GraphQL primary and REST fallback. Manage JWT auth lifecycle, refresh, and backoff. Maintain /fallbacks.ts and API observability.

⸻

Role 4 — QA & Release Steward

Test critical flows (auth, feed, compose, like/bookmark, theme switch). Confirm /healthz green, offline behavior OK, changelog updated, version bumped.

⸻

Role 5 — Docs & Changelog Curator

Maintain CHANGELOG.md starting where the previous one stopeed at. Update CHANGELOG.md for each completed milestone.

⸻

Global Prompts
	•	Compose Flow: “Create optimistic compose with rollback on error and haptic feedback.”
	•	Network Fallback: “Implement withFallback<T> between GraphQL and REST.”
	•	Degraded Mode: “Show banner if GraphQL fails ≥3× in 60s but REST succeeds.”

⸻

Maintenance Rules

Any schema or auth update requires regenerated types + refresh test. Update fallbacks in same PR.

⸻

Principle

“A great interface is not noticed. It is felt. Build Fomio’s experience to invite, not impress.”
