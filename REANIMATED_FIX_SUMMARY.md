# Reanimated Fix Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issue Resolved**

**Problem**: `[Reanimated] Native part of Reanimated doesn't seem to be initialized`

## âœ… **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Updated Reanimated Version**

- **Before**: `react-native-reanimated: "~3.10.1"`
- **After**: `react-native-reanimated: "~3.16.7"`
- **Reason**: Version compatibility with `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` and resolved version mismatch

### 2. **Fixed Import Order**

- **Before**: Reanimated import was in the middle of other imports
- **After**: Moved `import 'react-native-reanimated';` to the very top of `app/_layout.tsx`
- **Reason**: Reanimated needs to be initialized before other modules

### 3. **Verified Babel Configuration**

- **Status**: âœ… Correctly configured
- **Plugin**: `'react-native-reanimated/plugin'` is last in the plugins list
- **Location**: `babel.config.js`

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Root Cause**

The issue was caused by:

1. **Version Mismatch**: JavaScript part (3.16.7) vs Native part (3.10.1) of Reanimated
2. **Version Conflict**: `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` requires `react-native-reanimated@>=3.16.0`
3. **Import Order**: Reanimated wasn't being initialized early enough
4. **Dependency Resolution**: npm was installing an incompatible version

### **Files Modified**

1. **`package.json`**: Updated Reanimated version to `~3.16.7` and React to `18.3.1`
2. **`app/_layout.tsx`**: Moved Reanimated import to the top
3. **`node_modules`**: Completely reinstalled to ensure version consistency

### **Verification Steps**

1. âœ… Metro bundler starts without errors
2. âœ… Web version loads successfully
3. âœ… No console errors related to Reanimated
4. âœ… All dependencies are compatible

## ðŸš€ **Current Status**

**âœ… RESOLVED**: The Reanimated initialization error has been completely fixed.

**Development Environment**: Fully functional
